# Little background
In 2008, I developed a custom web browser designed to enhance the security of web applications. This browser incorporated advanced features, such as a keyboard hook, to safeguard sensitive information. The project gained significant recognition and, in 2009, it was officially adopted by the university rector to protect academic PDFs. The initiative was highly successful, achieving nationwide usage. It attracted considerable attention, with numerous academic research studies and hacking attempts focused on it.

At the time, the computing landscape was dominated by Windows and Internet Explorer. However, the rise of mobile devices and the evolution of computing have made it impractical to develop multiple specialized browsers.

I am particularly impressed by Mozilla's innovative approach with their PDF rendering engine, PDF.js. This open-source tool has become popular for securing PDFs. However, the intersection of Mozilla's open-source philosophy and its commercial applications has led to some challenges. Specifically, the Mozilla PDF viewer sometimes fails to meet the expectations of users seeking robust protection.

In response to these developments, I am exploring ways to leverage Mozilla's PDF.js for commercial use. This endeavor aims to create a versatile codes that balances the open-source foundations of PDF.js with the demands of commercial applications.
